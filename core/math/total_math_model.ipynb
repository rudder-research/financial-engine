To ensure a clean state and correct execution, I will regenerate all necessary class and function definitions (from `load_data_from_spreadsheet` up to `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` and its dependencies) in a single code block and then re-run the analysis.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4a4420bf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764270665302,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":171,"user":{"displayName":"Jason Rudder","userId":"09792846432201773029"}},"outputId":"b7979018-a266-45f9-f834-4f2d179a1797"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import stats\n","from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Callable\n","import warnings\n","import os\n","import json\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests\n","from scipy.linalg import svd, eig\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression\n","from scipy.stats import spearmanr\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","\n","def load_data_from_spreadsheet(file_path: str, sheet_name: str = None) -> pd.DataFrame:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Loads data from a specified Excel or CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n","    The first column is automatically parsed as dates and set as the DataFrame index.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        file_path (str): The path to the spreadsheet file (CSV or Excel).\n","        sheet_name (str, optional): The name of the sheet to read if it's an Excel file.\n","                                    Defaults to None, which reads the first sheet.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pd.DataFrame: The loaded and processed pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","    Raises:\n","        ValueError: If the file type is not supported or the file does not exist.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n","        raise ValueError(f\"File not found at: {file_path}\")\n","\n","    file_extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1].lower()\n","\n","    if file_extension == '.csv':\n","        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    elif file_extension in ['.xls', '.xlsx', '.xlsm', '.xlsb']:\n","        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type.

This indicates that `self.panel` somehow became a `dict` instead of a `pd.DataFrame` during runtime, despite explicit instantiation with a DataFrame. To diagnose this, I will add debug print statements at key points: after data loading, at the entry of `run_full_lens_analysis`, at the entry of `LensComparator.__init__`, and just before the problematic line in `LensComparator.run_all()`. This will help pinpoint exactly where the type conversion or corruption is occurring. I will also make a slight adjustment to `date_to_analyze` to ensure it exists in the panel index, by using `panel_data.index[0]` as a fallback if `panel_data.index[-1]` happens to not be present for some reason (though it should be).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3aa7fb87","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764270721431,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":299,"user":{"displayName":"Jason Rudder","userId":"09792846432201773029"}},"outputId":"e37aaabb-9d25-41be-aa15-c099563a8df1"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import stats\n","from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Callable\n","import warnings\n","import os\n","import json\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests\n","from scipy.linalg import svd, eig\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression\n","from scipy.stats import spearmanr\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","\n","def load_data_from_spreadsheet(file_path: str, sheet_name: str = None) -> pd.DataFrame:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Loads data from a specified Excel or CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n","    The first column is automatically parsed as dates and set as the DataFrame index.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        file_path (str): The path to the spreadsheet file (CSV or Excel).\n","        sheet_name (str, optional): The name of the sheet to read if it's an Excel file.\n","                                    Defaults to None, which reads the first sheet.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pd.DataFrame: The loaded and processed pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","    Raises:\n","        ValueError: If the file type is not supported or the file does not exist.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n","        raise ValueError(f\"File not found at: {file_path}\")\n","\n","    file_extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1].lower()\n","\n","    if file_extension == '.csv':\n","        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    elif file_extension in ['.xls', '.xlsx', '.xlsm', '.xlsb']:\n","        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type.

There was also a typo found in the `unique_insights` method within `LensComparator` which could lead to unexpected behavior. To definitively resolve this, I will regenerate the entire code block, incorporating the fix for the typo (`self.results[lens_name]` instead of `self.results[lens[name]]`), and ensuring that debug prints are fully active by deleting old definitions. This comprehensive refresh will ensure the correct code is executed and provide precise type information at each critical step.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ce659f33","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764271128784,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":378,"user":{"displayName":"Jason Rudder","userId":"09792846432201773029"}},"outputId":"deb306bf-098c-4a3e-ece0-5d1bd5500aa7"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import stats\n","from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Callable\n","import warnings\n","import os\n","import json\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests\n","from scipy.linalg import svd, eig\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression\n","from scipy.stats import spearmanr\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","\n","def load_data_from_spreadsheet(file_path: str, sheet_name: str = None) -> pd.DataFrame:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Loads data from a specified Excel or CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n","    The first column is automatically parsed as dates and set as the DataFrame index.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        file_path (str): The path to the spreadsheet file (CSV or Excel).\n","        sheet_name (str, optional): The name of the sheet to read if it's an Excel file.\n","                                    Defaults to None, which reads the first sheet.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        pd.DataFrame: The loaded and processed pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","    Raises:\n","        ValueError: If the file type is not supported or the file does not exist.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not os.path.exists(file_path):\n","        raise ValueError(f\"File not found at: {file_path}\")\n","\n","    file_extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1].lower()\n","\n","    if file_extension == '.csv':\n","        df = pd.read_csv(file_path, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    elif file_extension in ['.xls', '.xlsx', '.xlsm', '.xlsb']:\n","        df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0)\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type.

This is an unexpected behavior for a notebook environment. To ensure the code being executed is the latest version and to robustly handle potential type mismatches, I will resubmit the entire code block again. This time, I'll add an explicit type conversion (`pd.DataFrame(panel)`) in `LensComparator.__init__` and `run_full_lens_analysis` to guarantee `self.panel` is always a DataFrame, and also include `sys.version` and `pd.__version__` for environment debugging.

To fix this, I will modify the `load_data_from_spreadsheet` function to explicitly check if the result of `pd.read_excel` is a dictionary. If it is, it will then extract the correct DataFrame from the dictionary, either using the provided `sheet_name` or defaulting to the first sheet if `sheet_name` is `None`. This ensures that a `pd.DataFrame` is always returned, resolving the error.

Its capabilities include:\n","\n","1.  **Flexible Data Loading:** It can load time-series data from both Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`, etc.) and CSV files, automatically parsing the first column as dates and setting it as the DataFrame index. It intelligently handles Excel files that might contain multiple sheets, allowing specification of a sheet name or defaulting to the first available sheet.\n","2.  **Orchestrated Lens Application:** The engine serves as a central orchestrator, initializing and running a `LensComparator` with a suite of predefined mathematical lenses. These lenses include:\n","    *   **Magnitude Lens:** Quantifies overall activity (L2 norm).\n","    *   **PCA Lens:** Identifies underlying factors and their importance.\n","    *   **Granger Causality Lens:** Uncovers temporal predictive relationships between indicators.\n","    *   **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) Lens:** Extracts dominant temporal patterns, frequencies, and growth/decay rates.\n","    *   **Influence Lens:** Determines time-varying activity/volatility of indicators.\n","    *   **Mutual Information Lens:** Measures information-theoretic dependencies.\n","3.  **Comprehensive Result Saving:** After running all analyses, the engine systematically saves the processed data and the outputs from the `LensComparator`. These outputs include a lens agreement matrix, consensus indicators, and unique insights from each lens, all stored in a specified output directory for easy access and further interpretation.\n","\n","This design allows for highly flexible analysis of diverse time-series inputs, such as climate science data, by applying a comprehensive set of mathematical perspectives to reveal different facets of the data's behavior and interrelationships.\n","\n","## Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   The `load_data_from_spreadsheet` function was successfully implemented to parse both CSV and Excel files, automatically setting the first column as a datetime index. A critical fix addressed an issue where `pd.read_excel` could return a dictionary of DataFrames instead of a single DataFrame, ensuring robust data loading.\n","*   The `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` class was developed to encapsulate the entire analysis workflow, from data ingestion to results storage, promoting modularity and ease of use.\n","*   A dummy `climate_science_data.xlsx` file was generated, containing six fictional time-series climate indicators (`Global_Temp_Anomaly`, `Sea_Level_Change`, `CO2_Concentration`, `Arctic_Ice_Extent`, `Ocean_Acidity`, `Extreme_Weather_Events_Index`), effectively demonstrating the engine's applicability to time-series data.\n","*   The `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` successfully executed the full analysis pipeline using the generated climate data. This involved running all six mathematical lenses (Magnitude, PCA, Granger, DMD, Influence, Mutual Information) via the `LensComparator`.\n","*   The analysis results, including a lens agreement matrix, consensus indicators, and unique insights from each lens, were successfully saved to the specified output directory (`/content/climate_analysis_outputs`).\n","\n","## Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   **Insight:** The `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` provides a powerful, modular, and extensible platform for multi-faceted time-series analysis, capable of revealing complex relationships and dynamics within various indicator sets, such as those found in climate science. The `LensComparator` effectively synthesizes insights from diverse mathematical perspectives, highlighting both areas of consensus and unique findings.\n","*   **Next Steps:**\n","    *   Develop a visualization module to graphically present the outputs from each lens and the comparative insights (e.g., agreement matrices, top indicators), enhancing interpretability for domain experts.\n","    *   Integrate additional advanced time-series analysis techniques or domain-specific lenses (e.g., wavelet analysis, regime-switching models) to further enrich the engine's analytical capabilities.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"640a51ee"},"source":["# Task\n","The user has approved the current state. Now, I will implement a new mathematical lens using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify natural groupings or regimes within the time-series data. This lens will help in discovering hidden patterns and segmenting indicators based on their behavior. I will then integrate a time-series decomposition lens that can break down each indicator into trend, seasonal, and residual components. This will allow for a more granular analysis of the underlying dynamics and help in understanding long-term movements, periodic fluctuations, and unpredictable elements.

Its `analyze` method normalizes the input data, applies K-Means (with a configurable number of clusters), and returns cluster labels, cluster centers, and an 'importance' score for each indicator. This 'importance' is calculated as the standard deviation of each indicator's value across the cluster centers, signifying how much that indicator contributes to distinguishing between the identified clusters.\n","\n","Within the `LensComparator`, the `ClusteringLens` is added as another analytical perspective alongside other lenses (e.g., PCA, Granger Causality). The `LensComparator`'s `agreement_matrix`, `consensus_indicators`, and `unique_insights` methods have been updated to specifically look for the `'importance'` key in the `ClusteringLens`'s results dictionary. This allows the framework to compare the `ClusteringLens`'s assessment of indicator importance with that of other lenses, identifying indicators that consistently appear as important across different methodologies or those that are uniquely highlighted by the clustering approach.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   The `ClusteringLens` class was successfully implemented, performing K-Means clustering on normalized time-series data and accurately calculating indicator importance based on the standard deviation of cluster centers.\n","*   The `LensComparator` was updated to include the `ClusteringLens` in its analysis pipeline, enabling it to run alongside seven other analytical lenses.\n","*   The `LensComparator`'s comparative methods (`agreement_matrix`, `consensus_indicators`, `unique_insights`) were correctly modified to extract the `'importance'` metric from the `ClusteringLens` results, ensuring its insights are integrated into the overall comparison.\n","*   The full analysis pipeline, including data loading, execution of all eight lenses (including `ClusteringLens`), and generation of comparative reports (agreement matrix, consensus indicators, unique insights), executed successfully, confirming the seamless integration and functionality of the new lens.\n","*   Consensus indicator analysis showed that `Ocean_Acidity`, `Global_Temp_Anomaly`, and `Sea_Level_Change` were frequently identified as important across multiple lenses, suggesting their broad significance.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The `ClusteringLens` can provide insights into natural groupings or \"regimes\" within the time-series data, helping to understand periods of similar behavior across indicators. Further analysis of the `cluster_labels` could reveal these periods.\n","*   Given the successful integration, exploring different numbers of clusters (`n_clusters`) for the `ClusteringLens` could yield more nuanced understandings of data regimes and their defining indicators.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"22993e38"},"source":["# Task\n","Implement a NaN handling strategy in the `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` to preprocess `master_panel.csv` data using 'ffill', 'linear', or 'none' before analysis.

This suggests that either the interpolation methods did not completely remove all `NaN`s (e.g., leading `NaN`s for `ffill`, or `NaN`s at the boundaries for `linear`), or more critically, the `panel_norm = (panel - panel.mean()) / panel.std()` step within each lens could introduce new `NaN`s (e.g., if a column becomes constant after interpolation, its standard deviation is zero, leading to division by zero and `NaN`s). Therefore, the `dropna()` calls within these specific lenses were not redundant and are essential to ensure the algorithms receive clean data.

This was due to `NaN` values persisting or being re-introduced during internal normalization steps (e.g., if a column became constant after interpolation, leading to a standard deviation of zero and division by zero). The 'none' strategy naturally resulted in more widespread failures due to direct `NaN` presence.\n","\n","*   **Current Performance (with `dropna()` re-introduced in lenses):** With the `dropna()` calls re-introduced in `PCALens`, `DMDLens`, `MutualInformationLens`, and `ClusteringLens`, all lenses (Magnitude, PCA, Granger, DMD, Influence, Mutual Information, Clustering, Time-Series Decomposition) now successfully complete their analysis across all three NaN handling strategies ('ffill', 'linear', 'none').\n","    *   **'ffill' and 'linear' strategies:** These strategies fill `NaN`s before passing the data to the lenses. The subsequent `dropna()` within the lenses then handles any remaining `NaN`s (e.g., leading `NaN`s not caught by `ffill` at the start of a series) or `NaN`s introduced by normalization (e.g., constant series). This layered approach ensures robust data processing for each lens.\n","    *   **'none' strategy:** Even with no explicit preprocessing in `IndicatorAnalysisEngine`, the `dropna()` calls within each lens are sufficient to handle the missing values, allowing all lenses to complete. However, the effective dataset size for each lens may be significantly reduced compared to 'ffill' or 'linear', potentially affecting the quality of insights due to data loss.\n","\n","### Impact on Overall Analysis Results (Consensus Indicators & Unique Insights):\n","\n","The NaN handling strategy significantly influences the final results from the `LensComparator`.\n","\n","*   **'ffill' vs. 'linear' strategies:**\n","    *   **Consensus Indicators:** Both 'ffill' and 'linear' strategies produced a list of 10 consensus indicators with similar mean scores and standard deviations. While the absolute values of the scores might differ slightly due to the interpolation method, the top-ranked indicators (e.g., `nfci`, `anfci`, `walcl`, interest rates like `dgs10`, `dgs2`, `dgs3mo`) remain largely consistent. This suggests that for these lenses, both forward-fill and linear interpolation provide a reasonably similar holistic view of indicator importance across the overall time series.\n","    *   **Unique Insights:** Both strategies highlight similar unique insights. For instance, 'Granger' uniquely identifies 'walcl', 'DMD' uniquely identifies 'uso_uso', and 'TS_Decomposition' highlights the same set of highly seasonal indicators (`ppiaco`, `unrate`, `cpilfesl`, `cpiaucsl`, `payems`). This implies that the core relationships and patterns detected by the lenses are robust to the choice between forward-fill and linear interpolation for this dataset.\n","\n","*   **'none' strategy:**\n","    *   **Consensus Indicators:** The consensus indicators generated with the 'none' strategy differ notably. While some interest rate indicators appear, many other indicators that were present in 'ffill' and 'linear' strategies are absent. The reported mean_score and std_score values are mostly 0.0, which indicates that many lenses returned `NaN`s for these indicators, effectively excluding them from meaningful consensus calculation. This is because `dropna()` inside each lens removes rows with any `NaN`s, drastically reducing the data used by these lenses, leading to less comprehensive results.\n","    *   **Unique Insights:** Similar to 'ffill' and 'linear', 'Granger' and 'TS_Decomposition' still provide unique insights for some indicators. However, the 'DMD', 'PCA', 'MutualInfo', and 'Clustering' lenses, which rely on the `dropna()` step within their `analyze` methods, might produce results based on significantly truncated datasets, leading to potentially different interpretations of importance.\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","\n","Re-introducing `dropna()` calls within the individual lens `analyze` methods was crucial for ensuring their successful execution. While `ffill` and `linear` interpolation in the `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` successfully prepare the data upstream, `dropna()` within the lenses acts as a necessary safeguard against remaining `NaN`s or `NaN`s introduced by normalization (e.g., from constant series). Both 'ffill' and 'linear' strategies provide robust and consistent results for the comparative analysis. The 'none' strategy, while completing, leads to a much sparser and potentially less reliable set of insights due to extensive data loss from `dropna()` on raw data. Therefore, an explicit NaN handling strategy like 'ffill' or 'linear' followed by internal `dropna()` in lenses is recommended for comprehensive and stable results.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"45dd0b12"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   **Initial Lens Failures**: After implementing upstream NaN handling in `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` and initially removing `dropna()` calls from individual lenses, `PCALens`, `DMDLens`, `MutualInformationLens`, and `ClusteringLens` consistently failed. This was due to persistent `NaN` values (e.g., leading `NaN`s not caught by `ffill` or `linear` interpolation) or `NaN`s generated during internal normalization steps within the lenses (e.g., when a column became constant after imputation, leading to division by zero).\n","*   **Resolution of Failures**: Re-introducing explicit `dropna()` calls within the `analyze` methods of `PCALens`, `DMDLens`, `MutualInformationLens`, `ClusteringLens`, `GrangerLens`, and `TimeSeriesDecompositionLens` resolved all execution errors. This ensured that each lens received a completely clean dataset for its calculations.\n","*   **Impact of 'ffill' and 'linear' Strategies**: Both 'ffill' (forward-fill) and 'linear' (linear interpolation) NaN handling strategies, when applied upstream in the `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` and complemented by internal `dropna()` in lenses, resulted in the successful completion of all eight analytical lenses. These strategies produced largely consistent top consensus indicators and unique insights, suggesting a stable and comprehensive view of the data. For instance, top-ranked indicators like `nfci`, `anfci`, `walcl`, `dgs10`, `dgs2`, and `dgs3mo` remained consistent across these methods.\n","*   **Impact of 'none' Strategy**: While the internal `dropna()` calls in each lens prevented outright failures even with the 'none' (no upstream preprocessing) strategy, this approach led to significant data loss within individual lenses. Consequently, the resulting consensus indicators were sparser and often showed scores of 0.0 or NaN, indicating a less comprehensive and potentially less reliable analysis compared to 'ffill' or 'linear' strategies.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   **Robust NaN Handling Strategy**: A two-tiered NaN handling approach is most effective: implement an initial imputation strategy (like 'ffill' or 'linear' interpolation) within the main `IndicatorAnalysisEngine` for general data completeness, and retain specific `dropna()` calls within individual analytical lenses to ensure each algorithm receives a perfectly clean, non-NaN dataset, accounting for any residual NaNs or those generated during intermediate calculations (e.g., normalization of constant series).\n","*   **Choice of Imputation Method**: For this dataset, both 'ffill' and 'linear' interpolation yield comparable, robust results. The selection between these methods might depend on domain-specific knowledge about the data's temporal characteristics. Avoiding direct `dropna()` on raw data where possible (by using imputation) is crucial to preserve the maximum amount of information for a richer analysis.\n"]}]}
